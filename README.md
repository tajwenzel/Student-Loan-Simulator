# Student-Loan-Simulator
Flexible function for simulating different loan repayment plans at once.

# Why did I write this simulator?
Although many Algebra 2 classes teach the basics of compounding loan interest, applying those principles on one's actual loan were more difficult than I had anticipated. This is partially because loan servicers obscure key details and try to complicate a relitively simple formula such that people (usually students) will assume it is beyond their understanding and pay what is stated without question. 

In Science, a statistical model where the details are never given is called a 'black box' meaning no one knows what's going on inside and the validity of the model cannot be validated. 

I don't want anyone to be made to feel ignorant about their own money, and I think it's ridiculous that someone shouldn't be able to calculate exactly how much they owe in a way that matches very closely to what my loan servicer states. 

# What knowledge gap does it fill?
1) Most loan calculators online do not compare different repayment plans at once. If they do they do not graph the results in time.
2) Most loan calculators online cannot comphensate for lifestyle changes in payment. For example say you worked for a few years paid a portion of the loan and went back to school, so the loan went on hold. 
3) Most loan calculators online cannot comphensate for bulk payments. Say you came into some money would it be better to use it to over pay the loan now or maybe invest it? How much time do you cut off the end of the loan by overpaying now (e.g. 1 month or 2 years)? How much money do you save overall by overpaying now versus later. 
4) Most loan calculators can only handle one loan at a time and cannot give you a breakdown of multiple loans cumulatively and seperately. 

# What this model provides:
1) A personalized loan calculator that can accomodate multiple lifestyle changes and repayment plans so that you can make the best decisions for yourself.
